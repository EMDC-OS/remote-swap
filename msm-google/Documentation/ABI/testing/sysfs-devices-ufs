Description:
		This knob can be used to control target delay for UFS read requests.
		It receives a precentage value, and the default value is 100, which means
		no change. When 200 is written, the target latency with delay will be
		twice of an input latency, which is either the actual latency or a latency
		chosen by the degraded performance model when fragmented ftl emulation
		feature is enabled.

Description:
		This knob is used to control target delay for UFS read requsts.
		For each read request, this value will be added to the target delay.
		For instance, when 200 is set, all read requests will be delayed
		by 200 microseconds. The default value is 0, which means no delay.
