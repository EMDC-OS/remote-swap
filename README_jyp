**You should handle foreground==0 after real workload




// Optimization plan

- PTE walk (cold page sender)
send to nbd right after it is COUNTER>THRESHOLD ==> Pte walk 1/2

- PTE walk (send_target_page)  DONE!
add one bit in the entry, and set if the page is swapped (very cheap operation) 

// Implementation idea

Should handle if the process exit

flag off after it is sent
